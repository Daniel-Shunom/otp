A Gleam library for working with Erlang/OTP processes in a (mostly) type safe
fashion.

This library is experimental and will likely have many breaking changes in the
future!


## Quick start

```sh
# Build the project
rebar3 compile

# Run the eunit tests
rebar3 eunit

# Run the Erlang REPL
rebar3 shell
```
